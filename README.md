# Thrive Index SW

The Dashboard can be accessed on [StreamLit Community Cloud](https://thrive-index-sw-drrlyvx787hoxbrpqzny7z.streamlit.app/).

**A high-resolution data intelligence tool for measuring child prosperity at the neighbourhood level across South West England.**

The **Thrive Index SW** is a sophisticated dashboard designed to move beyond broad regional statistics. By aggregating millions of data points into a single, cohesive **"Thrive Score,"** it provides granular insights at the LSOA (*Lower Layer Super Output Area*), Ward, and Local Authority levels.

Unlike standard indices that often rely on simple averages, this project employs advanced data science techniques—including multiple imputation and principal component analysis—to ensure that every score is statistically robust, fair, and comparable.
